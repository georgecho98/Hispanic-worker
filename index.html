      <p>Dear all, i would like to share my couson's journey to find a job in USA. He is originally from El Salvado. At 17, He took a flight to Mexico and then a bus across the USA border.
        He landed on Texas and found a job at home depot. His boss is very nice and help him get a social security. His dream to make money and get a green card.

        Later he found a job in a construction company machine shop, and he start to get a career. This is a typical hispanic guy method to USA. He has a dream, but his country is the worst
        violent country in the world. It has the most killing. He also didn't contribute anything to America, but just come here to make money. 

        Also these hispanic countries are very far from Mexico (el salvado, Venezuela, Colombia, guatemala, honduras, costa rica,  haiti). These countries are not really supposed to be in the build america catalog. 
        A lot of people from these countries come to make money, but they don't contrbute back to USA. They all usually work in construction company.
